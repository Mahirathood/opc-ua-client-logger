Assignment 2: OPC UA Client Development and Data Logging

System Requirements:
This project was developed and tested on a Windows system using Python 3.x.
The following Python libraries are required:
- opcua
- pandas

Installation:
Install the required Python libraries using the command below:
python -m pip install opcua pandas

OPC UA Server Setup:
A local OPC UA server is implemented using Python to simulate OPC UA data.
The server can be started by running:
python opcua_server.py

Once started, the server runs locally at:
opc.tcp://localhost:1000

The server creates 10 dummy OPC UA tags (Tag1 to Tag10) and continuously
updates their values to simulate real-time data.

OPC UA Client Execution:
Open a new terminal window while keeping the server running.
Run the OPC UA client using:
python opcua_client.py

The client connects to the local OPC UA server and reads values from all
10 tags once every minute.

Data Logging:
Each data record includes:
- A human-readable timestamp
- Epoch time
- Values of Tag1 through Tag10

The collected data is automatically stored in CSV files inside the
'sample_output' folder.

The logging is designed to create CSV files on an hourly basis.
A new CSV file is generated automatically for each hour of data collection.

Output Files:
CSV files follow the naming format:
OPC_Log_YYYY-MM-DD_HH.csv

Stopping the Programs:
To stop the client, press CTRL + C in the client terminal.
To stop the server, press CTRL + C in the server terminal.

Purpose:
This assignment demonstrates basic OPC UA client-server communication,
periodic data acquisition, and automated data logging using Python.
This implementation is intended for academic and non-commercial use.
